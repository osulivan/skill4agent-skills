## What is this repository?

This is the official skill repository for skill4agent. Currently, it includes the `search-install-skill-zh` skill, which provides two ways to search and install skills:
- npx command (requires Node.js)
- API call (no Node.js required)

It supports searching skills in Chinese, making it more user-friendly for Chinese users.

## What are Skills?

In the simplest analogy:

- **Prompt** = You're standing next to an intern, telling them "do it this way"
- **MCP/Tool Call** = Giving an intern an access card and computer account, letting them use external tools
- **Skill** = Handing an intern a thick "Position SOP Manual + Templates + Scripts + Checklists" folder

Skills are essentially "reusable professional capability packages" or "standardized SOP toolkits" for AI. Through standardized file structures, they transform human professional expertise into resources that AI agents can read, allowing general AI agents to quickly "transform" into specialized AI agents without needing to develop customized models repeatedly.

When encountering such tasks in the future, AI will refer to this "manual" on its own, executing according to the steps, style, and specifications written inside, without you needing to hand-hold it every time.
